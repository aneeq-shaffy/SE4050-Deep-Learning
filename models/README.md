# Trained Models

This directory contains information about trained models for the News Category Classification project.

## Model Files Storage

Due to the large size of trained model files, they are stored on Google Drive instead of GitHub.

## ðŸ“¥ How to Download and Use

### Option 1: Download from Google Drive
1. Click the Google Drive link for the model you want
2. Download the entire model folder
3. Extract to the `models/` directory
4. Load in your notebook using the appropriate library (transformers, pytorch, etc.)

### Option 2: Use in Google Colab
```python
# Mount Google Drive
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Load model directly from Drive
model_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/SE4050-Models/distilbert_news_model'
```

## ðŸ”§ Model Training Information

All models were trained using:
- **Preprocessed Data:** `Dataset/processed/news_preprocessed.csv`
- **Train/Val/Test Splits:** `Dataset/processed/data_splits.pkl`
- **Label Encoder:** `Dataset/encoders/label_encoder.pkl`

For training details, see the respective notebooks in `Notebooks/`.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- Model files are stored on Google Drive due to GitHub's file size limitations
- All models are trained on the same preprocessed dataset for fair comparison
- For Colab usage, you can mount Google Drive to access models directly
- Local usage requires downloading model files from Google Drive first
